                    <p>Project objective: Capture appealing images of the castle for a travel magazine and advertising campaing of the North Bohemian region of the Czech Republic.
                    <p>The original medieval castle, extended in the 16th century to a Renaissance chateau, became the property of the famous Thirty Years War commander, Albrecht von Wallenstein in 1622, He turned it into the centre of his extensive Frýdlant duchy.</p> 
                    <p>The last noble owners were the Clam-Gallas, who opened the castle already in 1801 to the public; Frýdlant therefore became the oldest castle museum in Central Europe. Castle interiors can be seen (mementos from Albrecht von Wallenstein, the Knight’s Hall with portraits of the Gallas and Clam-Gallas owners, armoury, estate office, collection of historic pipes), as well as chateau interiors (state rooms, ladies’ and gentlemen’s rooms, children’s room, bathroom, kitchens). All the rooms are furnished with the original furniture, paintings, porcelain and other items. The Renaissance Chapel of St. Anne is also part of the tour. Occasionally the tours are enlivened by guides in costume, cake baking in the kitchens, concerts etc.</p>

                    <p>Project objective: Capture beauty of the maginficent historical landmark in warm colors of summer sunrise. For the museum's marketing purposes.
                    <p>Kuks is a small village situated in East Bohemia. In 1684, Count František Antonín Sporck became the owner of all local estates, including Kuks. At that time, Kuks was known only for its springs, which were believed by local people to have medicinal properties. Sporck set a very ambitious goal – to change Kuks into a world-renowned spa. Thanks to his immense wealth, the construction could start immediately. The spa was really magnificent and famous, even more so than Carlsbad.</p>
                    <p>What is of importance to us, however, is what was built on the opposite side of the Elbe river. Count Sporck constructed a hospital for army veterans. The Spanish Order of Brothers Hospitallers was invited to take care of old and injured soldiers from 1743 to 1938. During the Second World War, the hospital was turned into a reform school for misbehaving youngsters. From the end of the war to 1972, it served as a retirement house for the elderly.</p>
                    <p>Since 1946, the hospital building has been used as a museum of baroque art and Czech pharmacy. Currently owned by the state, the hospital was declared the National Monument of the Czech Republic in 1995.</p>

                    <p>Project objective: Capture aerial images of the whole museum and some separate airplanes, and other historical objects located in the museum.</p>
                    <p> Privvately owned aviation museum. Since its foundation in 1993, the aviation museum has grown a lot. What started as a hobby of a father and his son has grown into a museum containing exhibits divided into six categories: planes, helicopters, tanks, armored personnel carriers, cannons and replicas. The great number of complimentary entries in the visitors´ book obliges us to ensure that this remarkable growth will continue, offering our guests something new every year.</p>
                    <p>The most recent acquisition to the museum exhibits is TU-104 that has been installed near the museum entrance, partially sticking out towards the parking lot. This has been done on purpose as its wings are aimed to provide shade for your cars.</p>
                    <p>This year, some changes are planned to the basic zone, namely the installation of the L-410 cockpit fully equipped with a control panel. In addition, the basic zone will be enriched with the Ibis aircraft, originally located in the depository. Ibis will provide you with a shelter in case of summer showers. We also hope to manage to do something about the muddy terrain occurring in the museum after stronger rains.</p>
